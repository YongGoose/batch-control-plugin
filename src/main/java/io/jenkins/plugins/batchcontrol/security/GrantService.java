/**
 * Runtime authority on active grants (SPEC item 8). Keeps an in-memory cache of all grants,
 * backed by the file store ({@code grants/<id>.xml}), so the permission-check hot path
 * ({@link GrantAwareACL}) never touches disk.
 *
 * <p>Restart safety: {@link Jenkins} is a singleton, so there is exactly one live cache to keep
 * fresh; {@link #resetCacheOnStartup()} clears it unconditionally on every Jenkins startup, so
 * the very first query after a restart reloads straight from the files instead of serving
 * whatever happened to be in memory before. A grant that is still inside its window therefore
 * survives a restart and one whose window ended during the downtime is gone from the very first
 * check (SPEC item 8). Activity is always judged by {@link Grant#isActiveAt} against
 * {@link BatchClock} at check time — no timers.
 *
 * <p>S-15: the change-control switch gates whether a grant <em>confers</em> anything (that check is
 * in {@link GrantAwareACL}), and turning the switch off also closes the windows that are open at
 * that moment — see {@link #revokeAllActive()}.
 *
 * <p>D-74: a window names one item by its full name and follows that item. Item events keep the
 * names right ({@link WindowItemListener}): a rename or move updates the windows naming the item
 * ({@link #followItem}), a deletion ends them ({@link #endWindowsOf}). Renaming through a window is
 * refused (D-71c, {@link GrantAwareACL}), so only an administrator or a user with their own
 * permissions can move a window's name. S-39-02: no window or D-35c record is left on a name its
 * item no longer has: registration verifies the approved item is still at its name
 * ({@link #register}, D-71c (3)), and a window that cannot follow its item for certain ends instead
 * ({@link #followItem}). D-35c created-item records and, D-75 (2), the D-58a changed-under-grant
 * lists follow in memory first and their write is retried; an entry at a name another item has just
 * taken is dropped ({@link #relocateCreatedItem}, {@link #relocateChanged}).
 *
 * <p>D-74, a window's end is never lost: a window ends in memory first, so it confers nothing from
 * that moment, and its {@code GRANT_REVOKE} record is appended before its file is rewritten. If the
 * file cannot be written, the end is kept in {@link #unsavedEnds} and written again before every
 * later grant write, by every item event and by the periodic work ({@link #flushUnsavedEnds()});
 * every read of a grant file in this class applies it, so no other write can bring the window back.
 * If Jenkins stops before the end is written, the record stands in for it: when the cache is
 * loaded, a window whose file still says it is open but which has a {@code GRANT_REVOKE} record
 * is ended again ({@link #applyRecordedEnds}), so a restart cannot re-open it, also not on an item
 * created at its name in the meantime. S-39-03: that read is bounded by time, not by a record
 * count, and when it cannot be completed every open window ends (fail-closed).

     *
     * <p>Two things this does that {@link GrantAwareACL}'s switch check alone does not:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>it is <b>durable</b>. The ACL check makes an open window stop conferring while the
     *       switch is off; without the revocation, switching change control back on would bring
     *       every one of those windows back to life for the remainder of its duration (up to
     *       {@code maxGrantMinutes}, default 240). A revoked grant never returns —
     *       {@link Grant#isActiveAt} is false for it for good.</li>
     *   <li>it is <b>visible</b>. Each revocation appends a {@code ChangeRecord(GRANT_REVOKE)}
     *       naming the account that flipped the switch, the grantee whose window was closed and the
     *       position in the batch, so the audit history says who cut the work off and how much of it
     *       there was. A silent mass revocation would be worse than none: the users whose in-flight
     *       configuration changes suddenly stop working would have nothing to read.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>This is destructive to other people's in-flight work, by design.</b> Whoever turns the
     * switch off cuts off every change currently underway with no warning; that is the trade the
     * owner chose over a switch that leaves windows quietly open. The caller writes its own
     * CONFIG_TOGGLE record before calling this, so the history reads "the switch went off" and then
     * "these windows were closed", in that order.
     *
     * <p>No permission check of its own, deliberately, and unlike {@link #revoke(String)}: the
     * caller is a plain configuration setter whose only web entry point is core's
     * {@code /manage/configure} submission, already gated on {@code Overall/Administer} — which
     * implies {@code BatchControl/Manage} in any case. Putting a check here would instead impose a
     * permission gate on a setter that JCasC and startup also drive.
