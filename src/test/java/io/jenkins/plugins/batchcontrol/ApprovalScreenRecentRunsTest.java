/**
 * Regression cover for the approval screen's "recent runs" window, requested by ui-dev for
 * commit d6c0878. Matrix rows T-UI-01 (the allowed window sizes), T-UI-02 (the value is trimmed
 * and then matched against the allowed list; anything else falls back to the default of 5 without
 * an error page), T-UI-03 (the window is not a way
 * around the P-09 visibility model), T-UI-04 (a deleted target job still renders, with no run
 * history), T-UI-05 (the post-approval notice is bound to APPROVED + not yet executed) and
 * T-UI-06 (following the window control puts no crumb in the URL — ui-dev e98d211).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — provenance: unlike every other row in the matrix, T-UI-* is NOT derived from a
 * SPEC acceptance criterion. docs/SPEC.md says nothing about a recent-run table on the approval
 * screen or about a {@code runs} query parameter; the contract asserted here is the one the
 * implementation chose (reported by ui-dev), and these rows pin it so it cannot change silently.
 * Whether it belongs in SPEC is a human decision — see matrix note 40.
 *
 * Detection technique: the rows never assume a DOM shape. A run is "listed" when the page
 * references it either as a build URL of the job ({@code job/<name>/<number>/}) or as a
 * {@code #<number>} token that is not part of a longer token (so CSS colours such as
 * {@code #1f2937} cannot be mistaken for build #1).
 *
 * Written from docs/SPEC.md, docs/TEST-MATRIX.md and the ui-dev endpoint contract only
 * (no src/main knowledge).
