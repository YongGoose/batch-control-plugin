"""e2e-18: what changed in src/main after the e2e-17 build (bd449cd..d696d5d), checked in the browser.

usage: python final.py [KMDAS]   rows: out/final.jsonl, shots: R18-*.png
Switches the global switches, revokes every window (change control off) and replaces the authorization strategy for a
moment (S restores it), so ci/shard.py runs it as a `last` unit. Run r18/arrange.py first.

K  Creation-time saves (D-76 (2), 59a716e): the administrator copies r18/src-a to r18/copy-b on the New Item page
   ("Copy from"). The copy writes CREATE and no CONFIGURE record (store and History page). A real change afterwards (the
   administrator saves the copy's configure page with another description) is recorded as CONFIGURE with a diff
   against the creation baseline: the description lines only.
M  Notices of windows near their end (D-75 (1) b459904, expiry notice isolation 46fe0b5): w18 holds three 15-minute
   CONFIGURE windows (approved in this order): r18/iso-a, r18/vis-y, r18/iso-b. The administrator moves r18/vis-y into
   r18-vault (Move page; w18 cannot read the vault). The change request file of the iso-a window is made unreadable
   (fault injected; precondition: the JVM cannot read it). The administrator raises "Notify before expiry" to 30 minutes
   on the configuration page, so the next run of the periodic work (every minute) owes all three GRANT_EXPIRING notices.
   w18 gets the notices of vis-y and iso-b (one unreadable request no longer stops the others). The vis-y notice names
   the approved name r18/vis-y with the fixed "moved; its new location is not visible to you" line and never r18-vault.
   iso-a gets none, and Jenkins logs why. Then the file is made readable and the setting put back to 1 minute.
D  A refused approval while change control is off (3a934c8, LIMITATIONS 29): w18 files a request for r18/blk;
   approver-1 opens its page (Approve form shown); the administrator turns change control off (run control stays on,
   so records are written); approver-1 presses Approve on the page opened before. The answer is HTTP 400, the request's
   own page "Grant Request <id>" with the explanation "Change control is off, so permission windows cannot be
   approved. ..." and no form, no stack trace. The request is still PENDING, no window exists, and a
   GRANT_REQUEST_BLOCKED record by approver-1 is listed on approver-1's History page. Control: a GET of the page while
   off is the closed screen. Then change control is turned on again.
E  The APPROVED notice of a normal approval is unchanged (bf3e473 adds a line only when the window ended at
   registration): approver-1 approves the same request on its page; w18's APPROVED mail has exactly the lines of the
   format before the change (title, Request, Scope, Item kind, Actions, Duration, Requester, Link, Reason) and no
   "Window:" line; the window confers Configure.
A  Change-recording baselines (D-76 (1), 14d4532, e66a852): the administrator turns both switches off on the
   configuration page; while recording is off the administrator changes the descriptions of r18/old-a and r18/old-b and
   deletes and re-creates r18/rec-c with another description; no record is written. Both switches are turned on again
   (every snapshot is refreshed). configurer (standing Configure) saves r18/old-b's configure page without a change:
   no record. configurer changes r18/old-a's description: one CONFIGURE record with a diff from the description set
   while recording was off to the new one (never the one from before), shown on the History page (approver-1) and with
   its diff on the Changes tab. configurer changes the re-created r18/rec-c: its diff starts from the re-created item,
   not from the deleted one.
S  Strategy refusals as plain pages (8bfbe00, T-GAP-241): the administrator has the Batch Control configuration page
   open (Revert shown); in another browser context the administrator reverts (allowed). Pressing Revert on the page
   opened before answers HTTP 400 with "... is not a Batch Control strategy; there is nothing to revert." on core's
   plain error page, without a stack trace. With the plain matrix installed the /manage/ page offers "Install the Batch
   Control variant"; meanwhile the strategy becomes "Logged-in users can do anything" (script console, arrangement:
   another administrator's change on the Security page); pressing Install on the page opened before answers HTTP 400
   with "... has no Batch Control variant ..." and no stack trace. The original strategy object is put back."""
