"""e2e-19: unattended triggers on a real Jenkins: a real cron schedule and a real upstream trigger (SPEC 6, 6a).

usage: python triggers.py [TU]   rows: out/triggers.jsonl, shots: R19-TRIG-*.png   (run r19/arrange.py first)
T  r19-cron (timer every minute, created under run control: blockTimer, blockUpstream, not activated):
   1. the job page shows the trigger-lock notice naming "Block cron (timer) triggers" and "Block upstream triggers"
      and the activation notice "not activated" (SPEC 6 #21, 6a)
   2. the next minute's timer run is refused: no build, and a TRIGGER_BLOCKED record names the job, the cause kind and
      blockTimer (SPEC 6 #21)
   3. the administrator clears blockTimer: the notice no longer names it, and the next minute still starts nothing,
      because the job is not activated (SPEC 6a D-46: clearing a switch never lets a non-activated job run)
   4. requester asks for activation, approver-1 approves it in the browser: an ACTIVATED record, the job page says
      "activated", and the next minute's timer run starts with the timer cause; runs.csv lists it with cause TIMER
      (SPEC 6 "cron passes by default", 6a, SPEC 10 cause classes)
   5. a HOLD request approved in the browser: a HELD record, the job page says "on hold", the next minute starts
      nothing (SPEC 6a HOLD)
U  r19-ptsrc / r19-ptsrc2 trigger r19-ptdst through parameterized-trigger (the lock: blockUpstream, not activated):
   1. a run of r19-ptsrc: r19-ptdst refused, TRIGGER_BLOCKED record naming the upstream job and blockUpstream
   2. allow list = r19-ptsrc, still not activated: refused (activation needed)
   3. r19-ptdst activated: a run of r19-ptsrc starts r19-ptdst ("Started by upstream project r19-ptsrc"); a run of
      r19-ptsrc2 (not on the list) is refused and recorded naming r19-ptsrc2 (SPEC 6 R-1/D-16)
   4. blockUpstream off: r19-ptsrc2 now starts r19-ptdst whatever the list says (SPEC 6 D-16 second sentence)"""
