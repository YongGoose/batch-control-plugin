"""e2e-19: the run request life cycle as people meet it in the browser, with the e-mail it sends (SPEC 3, 4, 7, 12).

usage: python lifecycle.py [VDCSEXBF]   rows: out/lifecycle.jsonl, shots: R19-LIFE-*.png   (run r19/arrange.py first)
V  form validation on the Request Run page (requester): an empty reason and a reason over 4,000 characters are refused
   next to the field with the input kept and nothing stored; designating a user who is not on the approver list (REST)
   is refused with a message naming it, nothing stored (SPEC 3, 4)
D  decision rules: approver-2 (listed, not designated) sees no Decision form and a POST approve is refused, the request
   stays PENDING (D-29); approver-1's Reject with an empty comment is refused next to the field; Reject with a comment
   closes it; the requester's page shows REJECTED, who decided, when, and the comment (SPEC 4 D-28); approver-1 got
   the "New request awaiting your decision" mail and the requester the "Request rejected" mail, with the request id,
   job, requester, link and the reason quoted (SPEC 12 D-36)
C  approvers changed and cancel: the requester re-designates approver-2 on the request page: the Approver Changes table
   shows (approver-1 -> approver-2, requester, time) and approver-2 gets "Request routed to you" (SPEC 3, D-36);
   reqonly's POST cancel is refused; the requester cancels through the confirmation dialog (Cancel first, then OK):
   CANCELLED, "Cancelled by requester"; a second cancel is refused; approver-2 gets "Request cancelled", the requester
   gets no mail about their own cancel (SPEC 7, D-54)
S  administrator self-approval: admin requests a run designating admin and approves it: EXECUTED, the page says
   "Self-approved: Yes" and the stored request has selfApproved=true (SPEC 2)
E  approved-run expiry: with no executor, an approved request waits in the queue (APPROVED, "starts shortly"); the
   administrator disables the job, which cancels the queue item: the page says it waits because the job is disabled
   (D-55); after approvedRunTimeoutMinutes (1) it is EXPIRED with "Why it expired"; once the job is enabled again no
   build ever starts (check-at-submit, SPEC 7); the requester gets "Request expired" (D-54)
X  disabled job: while r19-dis is disabled the decision form says so, has no Approve button, and a POST approve is
   refused (PENDING kept); Reject still works (SPEC 12 D-55)
B  a request by reqonly (Request without Item/Build): the request page tells approver-1 that the requester does not
   have Build permission on this job (SPEC 6 D-38a)
F  requests.csv: a reason starting with = and a comment starting with @ are exported with a ' prefix (SPEC 10 R-3); the
   approver column holds the designated set joined by ';' and decidedBy is the last column (SPEC 12 D-37)"""
